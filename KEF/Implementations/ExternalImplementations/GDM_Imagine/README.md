# GDM: Growing Dual-Memory Self-Organizing Networks


Batch and incremental learning (with memory replay).

gdm_demo.py runs a demo on the Iris dataset as example.

You can export, import, and plot trained networks using gtls.py

For more demos, check out the GWR Toolbox: https://github.com/giparisi/gwr-tb
